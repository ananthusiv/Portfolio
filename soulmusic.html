            <p style="color: white;"><strong>Using AI for better personalization</strong><br> User research showed that most users listen to music based on their emotional needs, but often struggle to find songs that match their exact mood. Our challenge was to integrate a mood assessment feature that could easily identify their current emotional state and suggest music that resonates with how they feel.</p>
            <p style="color: white;"><strong>The proposed solution</strong><br> AI-driven mood assessment feature. We introduced an interactive mood assessment tool and a prompt input for users to select or describe their emotions before generating playlists tailored to their emotional needs. By combining this with AI and user data, we aimed to create a seamless experience for users seeking emotional relief through music.</p>

        <h3>What didn’t work?</h3>
        <p>Users noticed the "Create with Soul AI" button, but didn’t immediately connect it with creating mood-based playlists.

        <h3>What did work?</h3>
        <p>By adding more context around the AI's role in curating personalized playlists, we increased user engagement. Additionally, simplifying the button design and labeling led to more intuitive usage.</p>

    <h3>Priority Revisions</h3>
    <p >Since users didn’t have trouble finding the button, the challenge was clarifying the purpose of the "Create with Soul AI" feature, ensuring they understood its connection to personalized, mood-based playlists.</p>
    
    <h4>Idea 1: Add a brief explanation or tooltip</h4>
    <ul >
        <li style="color: white;"><strong style="color: white";> Pro:</strong> A small tooltip or short description appearing when users hover or tap the button could explain that the AI creates playlists based on their mood.</li>
        <li style="color: white;"><strong style="color: white;">Con:</strong> Too much text may clutter the UI or overwhelm users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Idea 2: Integrate mood check-in with the button</h4>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: white;"><strong style="color: white;">Pro:</strong> Introducing a quick mood check-in step before playlist creation would help users connect their emotional state with the playlist. This can provide clarity on how the AI works with their input.</li>
        <li style="color: white;"><strong style="color: white;">Con:</strong> Adding an extra step might feel like friction for users who want a fast experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Idea 3: Use visual elements to enhance understanding</h4>
    <ul>
        <li style="color: white;"><strong style="color: white;">Pro:</strong> Adding an emoticon or small icons that represent different moods alongside the button could make it clearer that the AI-generated playlists are mood-based.</li>
        <li style="color: white;"><strong style="color: white;">Con:</strong> This could affect the simplicity of the button design and may require careful balancing of visuals.</li>
